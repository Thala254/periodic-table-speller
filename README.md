# Periodic Table Speller

This project explores the algorithmic complexities (speed and memory) of checking if an input word can be "spelled" (case-insensitive) by a sequence of the chemical symbol abbreviations from the standard periodic table.

For example, the word "accept" can be spelled with Ac (Actinium) + Ce (Cerium) + Pt (Platinum).

The goal of this tool is to check if an input word can be "spelled" with the periodic table symbols, and then to show that sequence of element symbols.

## Instructions

1. Check out the `start-here` branch.

2. Consult the `app.js` module for the app logic already implemented:

    * Calls `Speller.check(..)` to attempt to spell an input word with the periodic table element symbols.

    * Calls `Speller.lookup(..)` to pull the periodic table element by its symbol (case-insensitive).

    * Note also the list of known test words in code comments. You'll want to use these as you test your solution!

3. Now consult the `speller.js` module for the algorithm logic to be implemented (look for the `TODO` comments):

    * The `loadPeriodicTable()` function loads the `periodic-table.json` file into the `elements` variable.

    * The `check(..)` function accepts an input word as a string (all lowercase letters) and returns an array (empty array if word couldn't be spelled).

    * The `lookup(..)` function accepts a symbol (as a string) and returns the periodic table element's entry/info, used to render the spelling as periodic table elements.

4. When you're ready, or if you get stuck in your own implementation, check out the `option-1`, `option-2`, and `option-3` branches and compare your solution to the ones provided.
